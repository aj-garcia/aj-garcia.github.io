---withouttime---
Try to imagine a life without timekeeping.

   You probably can't. You know the month, the year, the day of
the week. There is a clock on your wall or the dashboard of your
car. You have a schedule, a calendar, a time for dinner or a movie.
   Yet all around you, timekeeping is ignored. Birds are not late.
A dog does not check its watch. Deer do not fret over passing
birthdays.
   Man alone measures time.
   Man alone chimes the hour.
   And because of this, man suffers a paralyzing fear that
no other creature endures.
   A fear of time running out.

It won't do to say to a man, `You can create. Do so.'
It is much safer to wait for a man to say, `I can create, and I will do so whether you wish it or not.'
